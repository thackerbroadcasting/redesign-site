## Quote
The president of the United States has the ability to help our troops, have enough men and women to stay safe. In all of our history, in all of the time that we have been fighting, where did you leave these men and women but at one airport, one location, one gate to funnel thousands through? And who did you trust? You trusted our enemy to allow who would come through.

- Paula Knauss, mother of Ryan Knauss (quoted from [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/fallen-soldier-mother-blames-biden-trusted-enemy))
