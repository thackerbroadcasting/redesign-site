## Quote
City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of one of our own üôè

Beside his grave old glory waved for his country his life he gave, staring at his name etched in stone, he gave all and is not alone, looking up all I could see, were sacrifices made for you and me, tears of sorrow rolled down my face, what I would give to take his place, hard to express my feelings inside, empty and helpless most of all pride, we mourn our loss and our souls greive, he fought and died for what he believed, our flag will fly our anthem will play, never taking for granted our freedom today, priceless are the memories of our time together, the difference he made will last forever, I took my wife‚Äôs hand and we walked away, we buried our son a fallen hero today.

Thank you for your Service David Lee Espinoza, City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of a HERO

- Gilbert Aguilar Jr, Mayor of Rio Bravo, TX
