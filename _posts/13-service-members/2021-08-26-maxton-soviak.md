## Quote
His final words to (Rachel) over FaceTime, when he was telling her goodbye was after she told him to be safe and he said ‘Don’t worry mom, my guys got me they won’t let anything happen to me.’ Today she realized that they all just went together.

- Kip and Rachel Soviak, Max’s parents, in a statement to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/us/kabul-attack-us-service-members-killed/index.html).
