# The BLM Movement - and its hipocrisy - is absurd

I’m all for activism. There are definitely events where protests are necessary, such as Occupy Wall Street in September 2011. But a recent group has come to light, mostly thanks to our ‘good friend’: the mainstream media. However, the recent group has more of a… violent reputation when it comes to their protests.

Black Lives Matter.

The movement was running rampant during the summer of 2020 in protest of George Floyd, a black man who was killed after his neck was kneeled on by a police officer. However, the movement conveniently forgot that he was a career criminal, and the whole reason police showed up in the first place was to respond to - you guessed it - a crime.

In the following months, protests broke out across the country in response to the “police brutality” that had occurred due to “white supremacy” and “systematic racism”, giving the movement a whole new spotlight that had never been seen before.

Those who attempted to say “what about white lives” were immediately brought down with some being physically beaten. So when something is done in the name of “Black Lives Matter”, everything is fine. Loot and burn down businesses. Beat people. Kill if you want. If it is in the correct name according to the Democratic Party, nothing will happen. However, do it in the name of something they don’t agree with and you will suffer the wrath of a polarized and very broken justice system. It is absurd.

Americans collectively agree that deaths of and from police officers are bad; they’re quite tragic in every situation. But do these people honestly think that police officers like killing people? Absolutely not. Is that what the far-left has really come to believe?

Every time a police officer has shot someone since that fateful day in 2020 has had its share of people chanting “defund the police”, “ACAB”, “blue lives don’t matter”, and “killer”. These chants are unwarranted, and quite racist when you think about it. Saying that someone should die because of their occupation is just as bad as those in Nazi concentration camps because of their outward appearance and religious beliefs.

But take a closer look. These chants only happen when a white police officer shoots a black individual. Throw these chants out the window if you think they’ll happen for a white criminal.

Take a look at those who participated in the January 6th storm on the capitol.

While I personally don’t agree with what happened on January 6th, it serves to show how far the left is willing to go when something adversely affects them. Don’t believe me?

Take a look at the punishments you deal with if you have not been vaccinated against Covid. Your compliance to get the jab — twice even — is more important to them than your job, your welfare, or even your family. And there are no exceptions.

The only exceptions the left believes should exist focus around abortion, the taking-away of another human beings life. Murder is healthcare. Murder is justice. But choosing to not be vaccinated with an experimental drug is grounds to be removed from society (which, if you ask me, isn't necessarily a bad thing). At this point, you can be 'cancelled' for not being vaccinated. However, with several lawsuits against the Biden Administration for overstepping their boundaries and not following the proper procedures for such actions, it is looking as though the mandate itself will be cancelled. A victory for cancel culture.
