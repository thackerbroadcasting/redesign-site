# The Backward Evolution of America

The last few months have shown a more sinister side to what people considered to be the kind, gentle, loving Biden Administration. Interesting to think of a government entity as “kind” at any point in time, but pushing that aside, the administration has created a bit of a pandemic of their own inside of COVID. A pandemic that may be familiar to those who remember the 1940s and 1950s. One where a particular group of people were not allowed opinions of their own. One that people insist exists today, calling it “systematic”. Interestingly, these calls come from people who never had to endure what they claim was a burden placed on them by “the system” as they were raised in middle-class areas.

You guessed it. Racism.

Over the past few months, some interesting calls have been made from the black community, some that others thought were outrageous, egregious, and outright wrong. Now is everything that the black community spoken out about wrong? Absolutely not. There are some issues that still need to be addressed.

But we’re addressing the wrong issues at the wrong time, with some of them so absurd that they should never need to be addressed. Some of the more outrageous ones have been addressed, but other calls draw interesting attention from those on both sides of the political spectrum.

“Defund the police”

“Black Lives Matter”

“Toxic Masculinity”

Calls like these draw raised eyebrows, and genuine questioning from all around. So why are these calls coming up at such a weird time in our nation? And how can we solve it? Well, one party likes to think they have the answers, and it invokes something we know as “backward evolution”.

So what is “backward evolution”? It’s pretty straightforward. You’re going back on evolution, going back on things we’ve learned, going back to old, outdated, “racist” policies because they were “better”. But is that true?

“Defund the police”

“Defund the police”, they said. Why? Because of racism; because in their eyes, there is no such thing as a black police officer. White people are racist! They’re the only ones who commit crimes against black people despite statistical data showing that 80% of crimes against black people are done by black people.
Interestingly, crimes committed against black people 80% of the time are from their own race.

“Black Lives Matter"

”Toxic Masculinity"
