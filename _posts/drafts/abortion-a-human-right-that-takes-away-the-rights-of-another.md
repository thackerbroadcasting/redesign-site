# Abortion - a 'basic human right' that takes away the rights of another

With the recent controversies happening in the state of Texas, one stands out among the others. The Lone Star state recently implemented a bill that makes it illegal for an abortion to be performed after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks. Liberals have toted the fact that abortion, the killing of an unborn human being, is in fact "healthcare", even going as far as to say that "Abortions save lives". How exactly does abortion save lives? Liberals won't elaborate, saying that it should be a woman's right on what she should be able to do with her body. True, and I'm all for each person deciding what to do with their body. But at what point does it no longer become your choice?

When does it become someone else's body and someone else's choice?
Texas has decided that the moment a heartbeat from the unborn child is the moment that another human being is recognized, and the choice of abortion is no longer the mothers. This is a great step forward in society. But it has also resulted in one of the bigger backlashes in recent time, aside from the Covid vaccine mandates, with women - sorry, 'birthing persons' - coming from all over the country to protest the new law that protects the unborn.

The Fetal Heartbeat

This question has been presented for years, and debated heavily. Women who sleep around and have experienced the "whoops, I'm pregnant" scare tote their flag that abortions save women's lives who don't want to have kids. If they are so adamant about not wanting kids, maybe they shouldn't be sleeping around with every guy from their high school. Just a thought.

Okay, so she sleeps around and gets pregnant. Now what?

But then that begs the question: what about the father? What do you do if the father wants to keep the child, while the mother doesn't?
